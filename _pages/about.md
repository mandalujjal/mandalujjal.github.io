I am Ujjal Mandal, currently a Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad (IIITA), with
a specialization in photoacoustic signal and spectrum generation using computational tools such as MATLAB, C, C++,
and CUDA C. My academic career has been distinguished by earning both Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) and Senior
Research Fellowship (SRF) awards. I have a strong track record of publications and experience in teaching courses like
numerical methods, tomography imaging, and engineering physics.
With over 4 years of experience as a Research Assistant in [Computational Biomedical Physics](https://www.nature.com/subjects/computational-biophysics), I am skilled in leveraging
advanced computational techniques to push the boundaries of biomedical research, particularly in optoacoustic methods.
I thrive in both independent and collaborative settings, excelling in data gathering and analysis to support scientific research. My diverse expertise enables me to quickly adapt to new challenges and contribute effectively to innovative research
initiatives.
