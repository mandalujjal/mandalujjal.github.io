This study numerically solves inhomogeneous Helmholtz equations modeling acoustic wave propagation in homogeneous and lossless, absorbing and dispersive, inhomogeneous and nonlinear media. The traditional Born series (TBS) method has been employed to solve such equations. The full wave solution in this methodology is expressed as an infinite sum of the solution of the unperturbed equation weighted by increasing power of the potential. Simulated pressure field patterns for a linear array of acoustic sources (a line source) estimated by the TBS procedure exhibit excellent agreement with that of a standard time domain approach (k-Wave toolbox). The TBS scheme though iterative but is a very fast method. For example, GPU enabled CUDA C code implementing the TBS procedure takes 5 s to calculate the pressure field for the homogeneous and lossless medium whereas nearly 500 s is taken by the later module. The execution time for the corresponding CPU code is about 20 s. The findings of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the TBS method for solving inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation, while the GPU-based implementation significantly reduces the computation time. This method can be explored in practice for calculation of pressure fields generated by real transducers designed for diverse applications
