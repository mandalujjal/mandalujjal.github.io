Numerical implementation of the Born series procedure is a computationally expensive task. Various computational strategies have been adopted and tested in this work for fast execution of the convergent Born series (CBS) algorithm for solving inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation in the context of biomedical photoacoustics (PAs). The PA field estimated by the CBS method for a solid circular disk approximating a red blood cell exhibits excellent agreement with the analytical result. It is observed that PA pressure map for a collection of red blood cells (mimicking blood) retains the signature of multiple scattering of acoustic waves by the acoustically inhomogeneous PA sources. The developed numerical tool realizing the CBS algorithm compatible with systems having multiple graphics processing units can be utilized further for accurate and fast estimation of the PA field for large tissue media.
